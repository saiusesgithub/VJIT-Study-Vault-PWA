## 💡 Overview

### Evolution: From Mobile App to Universal PWA
**VJIT Study Vault** has evolved from a mobile-only application to a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, making academic resources accessible on **any device with a browser** - laptops, tablets, phones, and desktops.

### Problem
Students struggle with **scattered study materials** across various platforms and need access from multiple devices - their phones during commute, laptops during study sessions, and tablets during classes.

### Solution
Our **PWA solution** centralizes all academic materials in a **cross-platform web application** that works seamlessly across all devices. It provides **personalized access** based on branch, year, and semester, with **offline capabilities** and **native-like performance**.
